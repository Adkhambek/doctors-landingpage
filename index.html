                    medicine, but you're not a doctor. I feel like if I had my personality but was an OB/GYN, you would
                    be psyched. You'd be like, 'My chatty, pop-culture-interested but plainspoken,
                    wants-to-talk-about-clothes but serious-minded doctor.' I feel like I would clean up with patients.
                    That's kind of a cocky thing to say.</p>

                    You might instead, go to church. The most memorable interviews for me are folks whose names I don't
                    know: young civil rights leaders in the South, showing great courage as they walked into a town in
                    the dark of night. A doctor working for 'Doctors Without Borders' in Somalia, operating by kerosene.
